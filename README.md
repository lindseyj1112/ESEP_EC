Instructions to run code:

- build using Gradle from your selected IDE
- run the Main file
- follow the menu and input prompts in the console to start/end transactions, add/update/commit/rollback key/value pairs, or exit the program

Assignment feedback:
  To make this an official assignment, I think there should be a clearly associated lecture/instruction video
to go with it to make getting started easier. I think the structure of the functions/interface should either be
more vague (allowing more creativity on the students' part) or starter code should be provided to fill in for each required
method, as was done in other assignments (I like this option better). If kept as an extra credit option, I think this assignment 
should also be made available sooner, since there were some assignments this semester that were very time consuming and challenging, 
so many students may like to know what the alternative replacement option is sooner so they don't stress so much about a particularly
tough assignment.
